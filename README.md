enfspatch
=========
Additional methods and patches for node fs module

**enfs** stands for [E]asy [N]ode [fs]

This module is intended to work as a sub-module of [enfs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enfs)

Description
-----------
This module will change some behaviors of fs module from node
such as creating a queue for opening files when limit is reached,
catching the error's and proceeding with the process when possible.
This module implements many methods through [enfsaddins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enfsaddins)
  
Usage
-----
`enfspatch` is a drop-in replacement for native `fs` module, you just need to include
it instead of the native module.

Use this
```js
    var enfs = require("esnofspatch");
```

instead of

```js
    var fs = require("fs"); //You don't need to do this anymore
```

and all the methods from native fs module are available

Errors
------
All the methods follows the node culture.
- Async: Every async method returns an Error in the first callback parameter
- Sync: Every sync method throws an Error.
